Where to invest our time/effort:
- new features (notifications/followers) - MOST WORK
- UI Changes - WHERE? 
- Presentation: prove as users that this is useful. Bart example. One focused on busy person who has an idea - records 2 tracks instead of just one. THe other be more community or discovering/connecting with others.
- Home screen: suggested tags in big circles --> "vocals" "needs_rhythm" 

Location - helps people connect. What's the next step after collaboration. 
- Easier: Share on facebook. Being ablet o see people on facebook. Request as friend on fb.  --> DONT NEED
- Crashes
- Commenting
-
